Coding Challenge Guidelines
===========================

Please organize, design, test, document and deploy your code as if it were
going into production, then send us a link to the hosted repository (e.g.
Github, Bitbucket...).

Functional spec
---------------

Prototype **one** of the following projects:

1. Departure Times
1. Email Service
1. Food Trucks

The UX/UI is totally up to you. If you like, get creative and add additional
features a user might find useful!

### Departure Times

Create a service that gives real-time departure time for public transportation
(use freely available public API). The app should geolocalize the user.

Here are some examples of freely available data:

* [511](http://511.org/developer-resources_transit-api.asp) (San Francisco)
* [Nextbus](http://www.nextbus.com/xmlFeedDocs/NextBusXMLFeed.pdf) (San
  Francisco)
* [Transport for London Unified API](https://api.tfl.gov.uk/) (London)


### Email Service

Create a service that accepts the necessary information and sends emails. It
should provide an abstraction between two different email service providers.
If one of the services goes down, your service can quickly failover to
a different provider without affecting your customers.

Example Email Providers:

* [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/user/signup) - [Simple Send Documentation](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API/mail.html)
* [Mailgun](http://www.mailgun.com) - [Simple Send Documentation](http://documentation.mailgun.com/quickstart.html#sending-messages)
* [Mandrill](https://mandrillapp.com) - [Simple Send Documentation](https://mandrillapp.com/api/docs/messages.JSON.html#method-send)
* [Amazon SES](http://aws.amazon.com/ses/) - [Simple Send Documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/APIReference/API_SendEmail.html)

All listed services are free to try and are pretty painless to sign up for, so
please register your own test accounts on each.

### Food Trucks

Create a service that tells the user what types of food trucks might be found
near a specific location on a map.

The data is available on [DataSF](http://www.datasf.org/): [Food
Trucks](https://data.sfgov.org/Permitting/Mobile-Food-Facility-Permit/rqzj-sfat)

Technical spec
--------------

You are also free to use any Java library hosted in a maven repository. If you choose to use a framework
that results in boilerplate code in the repository, please detail in your
README which code was written by you (as opposed to generated code).

### Front-end

The front-end should ideally be a single page app with a single `index.html`
linking to external JS/CSS hosted on JSdelivr or similar.
You may take this opportunity to demonstrate your CSS3 or HTML5 knowledge.

Host it!
--------

When youâ€™re done, host it somewhere (e.g. on Amazon EC2, Heroku, Google AppEngine, etc.).

How will we review?
-------------------

Regardless of whether it's your own code or our coding challenge, write your README as if it was for a production service. Include the following items:

* Description of the problem and solution.
* Whether the solution focuses on back-end, front-end or if it's full stack.
* Reasoning behind your technical choices, including architectural. 
* Trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project.
* Link to other code you're particularly proud of.
* Link to your resume or public profile.
* Link to to the hosted application where applicable.

How we review
-------------

**We value quality over feature-completeness**. It is fine to leave things aside provided you call them out in your project's README. The goal of this code sample is to help us identify what you consider production-ready code. You should consider this code ready for final review with your colleague, i.e. this would be the last step before deploying to production.

The aspects of your code we will assess include:

* **Architecture**: how clean is the separation between the front-end and the back-end?
* **Clarity**: does the README clearly and concisely explains the problem and solution? Are technical tradeoffs explained?
* **Correctness**: does the application do what was asked? If there is anything missing, does the README explain why it is missing?
* **Code quality**: is the code simple, easy to understand, and maintainable?  Are there any code smells or other red flags? Does object-oriented code follows principles such as the single responsibility principle? Is the coding style consistent with the language's guidelines? Is it consistent throughout the codebase?
* **Security**: are there any obvious vulnerability?
* **Testing**: how thorough are the automated tests? Will they be difficult to change if the requirements of the application were to change? Are there some unit and some integration tests?
	* We're not looking for full coverage (given time constraint) but just trying to get a feel for your testing skills.
* **UX**: is the web interface understandable and pleasing to use? Is the API intuitive?
* **Technical choices**: do choices of libraries, databases, architecture etc. seem appropriate for the chosen application?

Bonus point (those items are optional):

* **Scalability**: will technical choices scale well? If not, is there a discussion of those choices in the README? 
* **Production-readiness**: does the code include monitoring? logging? proper error handling?
